📜 Project Code of Conduct: Keylogger Simulation (Python)

1. 🔒 Ethical Purpose & Boundaries
This project is strictly for educational and awareness purposes in cybersecurity.
It must only be executed in controlled environments—like labs or virtual machines—with informed consent from involved parties.
Under no circumstance should the software be used for surveillance, exploitation, or unauthorized data collection.

2. ⚖️ Consent & Transparency
All tests and demonstrations require explicit written consent from users or participants.
A clear disclaimer must be provided outlining:
The project’s intent
What data is captured
Where the data is stored and for how long

3. 🛡️ Privacy & Data Handling
Captured keystroke logs must be stored locally and securely—never transmitted online.
Encryption techniques (e.g. hashing sensitive input or secure file access) should be employed to protect integrity.
Logs should be automatically deleted or anonymized after analysis.

4. 🚫 Prohibited Use
This project must not be used for:
Credential theft
Unauthorized monitoring
Data manipulation or tampering
Any use outside the intended scope will violate academic ethics and may breach legal statutes.

5. 📚 Academic Integrity
All code, documentation, and experiments must be original or properly attributed.
The simulation should reflect responsible cybersecurity practices as outlined by institutions like NIST and ISO.
Peer feedback and mentor validation are encouraged before publishing findings or results.

6. 🧪 Technical Transparency
The source code must include comments detailing:
How the pynput listener is implemented
How logs are managed and protected
What safeguards are in place to restrict unintended access
The README should explain the setup, testing instructions, and ethical guidelines.

7. 🧠 Learning & Reflection
Project outcomes should highlight:
How keystroke data can be exploited in real-world attacks
The importance of endpoint protection and user awareness
Personal learnings about security tools and ethical dilemmas
