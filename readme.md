# 🔐 Keylogger Simulation – Ethical Cybersecurity Project

## 📘 Overview
This Python-based keylogger was developed as part of my internship project with Pinnacle Labs to explore ethical monitoring tools in cybersecurity. The tool is designed strictly for educational and research purposes, emphasizing consent, controlled usage, and responsible data handling.

## ⚙️ Features
- ⌨️ Captures keystrokes in real-time using the `pynput` library
- 📁 Stores logs locally with timestamps for input behavior analysis
- 🔐 Ensures data privacy with secure logging and encryption (if implemented)
- 🧪 Supports ethical use cases like phishing simulation analysis and user awareness training

## 📂 Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/srii19/Keylogger-Software
   
Install dependencies:
bash
pip install pynput

Run the script:
bash
python keylogger.py

⚠️ Warning: Use only in environments with explicit consent. Avoid deployment on shared or unauthorized systems.
🧭 Use Case

Designed for cybersecurity awareness campaigns and educational simulations.
Helps demonstrate how keystroke data can be monitored and why user vigilance is critical.
Encourages understanding of endpoint protection and defensive strategies.

📜 Code of Conduct
This software follows a strict code of ethics:
Must be used only for educational and research purposes
All tests must involve informed consent
Data captured must remain local and secured
Unauthorized use is strictly prohibited
For more, refer to CodeOfConduct.md.

🧠 Learning Outcomes
Practical understanding of input tracking mechanisms
Ethical implications of surveillance tools
Reinforcement of cybersecurity best practices

🗣️ Acknowledgments
Thanks to Pinnacle Labs for the mentorship and guidance throughout the internship. Grateful for the opportunity to build, reflect, and grow through responsible cybersecurity simulations.
